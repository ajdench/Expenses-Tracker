### Critical Bug Report: Application Controls Not Rendering

**Issue:** The main application controls (trip cards, add trip card, section headers) are not rendering on the main page. The page appears blank or incomplete.

**Symptoms:**
- No trip cards are visible in the "Active", "Submitted", or "Reimbursed" sections.
- The "Add Trip" shadow card is absent.
- The main UI elements that should be dynamically generated by `ui.js` are missing.
- This indicates a severe JavaScript error preventing the main rendering functions from executing.

**Context:**
This issue re-appeared after a series of UI/UX refactoring attempts, particularly within the `ui.js` file. The application was previously functional before these changes.

**Last Attempted Fix & Outcome:**
My last attempt to resolve this was to correct a suspected critical bug in the `save` function within `buildAddTripShadowCard` (specifically, the event listener re-attachment logic). I overwrote `ui.js` with a version that I believed contained the fix. However, this attempt was unsuccessful, and the rendering issue persists.

**Hypothesis for Persistent Failure:**
Despite the targeted fix, the issue remains. This suggests one or more of the following:
1.  **Incorrect Root Cause:** The identified bug in `buildAddTripShadowCard` was not the primary or sole cause of the rendering failure.
2.  **New Bug Introduced:** The "fix" itself, or other changes made concurrently, introduced a new, equally critical JavaScript error that halts script execution.
3.  **Undiscovered Error:** There is another, undiscovered critical error in `ui.js` (or potentially `styles.css` if it's a CSS parsing error, though less likely to cause a blank page) that is preventing the script from running.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1.  Serve the project files (e.g., using `npx serve` or `python3 -m http.server`).
2.  Open the application in a web browser.

**Current State:**
- The `ui.js` and `styles.css` files are in the state resulting from the last `write_file` operations performed by the Gemini CLI agent.

**Next Steps (as per user instruction):**
- No further code changes are to be made by the agent.
- The issue has been documented in this `bug-log.md` file.
